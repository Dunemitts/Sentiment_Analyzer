1,breakfast:5★ cleanliness:5★ price:5★ service:5★ location:5★,48,"	Great Hotel. Lively 	This is a great hotel. Stay in room 609 which was very spacious. Friendly staff large rooms and easy access to central london (about 25mins by tube). The rooms and the hotel itself could do with a facelift but for comfort and quality I would stay here again. I got a good price online because I booked early. I have stayed in many London hotels with cramped rooms and rude staff but this is a very professional place

2,location:0★ service:0★ price:0★ breakfast:0★ cleanliness:0★,-6,"	Do not stay here the rooms and food were awful!!!!	Me and my partner stayed here for the weekend just gone and we thought the hotel was not very nice. The rooms need up dating it was all old fashioned furniture and style. At first we wasnt too bothered about that then we went down for breakfast and the food was terrible. The scramble eggs were runny there was not veggy option which was not good as i did not have a good choice of food i could get. The tea and coffee was cold and the fruit was not fresh at all!!!! would not recommed to stay here!!!

3,breakfast:2★ cleanliness:0★ service:0★ price:0★ location:0★,-7,"Nov 23 2009	Fancy breakfast with strangers? If so go here.	My mum and i travelled to london for the weekend in october and we were lucky enough not to have to be in the room for very long at all. The location is good as it is only a small walk away from a shopping centre and the tube station and as you enter the hotel it looks lovely. We arrived on the friday afternoon and were asked if we would like to upgrade our room for ï¿½25 extra.The lifts were slow to arrive and sometimes didn't arrive at all even after pressing the button countless times. The view was good but the window did not open and the air conditioning was broken so the room was very stuffy. The beds were resonably comfy and the bathroom as quite nice but the breakfast had to be the worst breakfast i have ever had you go in and sit at large tables with people you dont even know we ate breakfast as quickly as we could and went to buy it elsewhere. I did not enjoy being in the hotel much but thankfully had a excellent time seeing wicked and ross noble while there.

4,breakfast:0★ cleanliness:1★ price:0★ service:0★ location:0★,-6,"Nov 21 2009 	Don't Stay Here	I too suffered attempted blackmail at check-in. The receptionist wanted ï¿½30 for a 'better' room. All indications were that he expected this to be in cash into his hand.Whilst the room was adequate (and the shower - the best part of the stay - surprisingly good) the bathroom suffered from nicotine stains on the ceiling. The restaurant staff are rude and at breakfast required full payment before you could even enter the breakfast room so be prepared to make your English/Continental selection before you even see any food.From their website you could be fooled into thinking there is WiFi available but this seems to be restricted to certain room types.The hotel is tired and run by bandits - my advice is to spend your money elsewhere.

5,price:0★ breakfast:0★ cleanliness:0★ service:0★ location:0★,-41,"Nov 16 2009 	Good experience except for attempted blackmail when checking in	The receptionist explained that we were in an exec-deluxe room (or something like that) which was very good and our rate was an excellent one. Pause. But for only ï¿½40 more we could have an excellent room. &quot;No thank you&quot; I said. He then scribbled a room number on a slip and pushed it towards us. &quot;Smoking is fine&quot; he said more of a statment than a question. &quot;Smoking is not fine&quot; I said. He then stated dimissively it will have to be a Standard room. More scribbling and &quot;Twin beds is OK?&quot; No I said we paid for a non smoking double and that is what we expect. He muttered and then waited no doubt expecting us to say go on then we'll pay the extra but then his colleague shouted across a room number and he scribbled some more and gave us our room number without saying anything else. I can't help but feel he was working to a script or on commission but it was disgraceful.The room itself was clean and comfortable. Quite a new toilet and tiled floor carpet looked clean and fairly new bed was comfortable and clean room temperature was fine and it was fairly quiet. Dining room for breakfast was hot and crowded but cooked breakfast was fine.I was charged more than the overnight parking rate given on the web if fact more than the 24 hour rate. I only realised that later though :(I booked in a rush before getting a chance to read reviews and my heart sank when I read some of the bad experiences. But apart from the check-in blackmail I was very pleasantly surprised. It must be hit or miss. The extortion attempt would make me avoid it in the future and not recommend it.

8,price:0★ breakfast:0★ cleanliness:0★ service:0★ location:0★,-22,"Nov 5 2009 	Awful - much nicer hotels to stay in for same price	I recently stayed for 1 night at the Britannia Hotel and since I was on business I wasn't looking for a luxurious stay just a clean comfortable room that I felt safe in. Sadly the room didn't tick any of these boxes. The room was extremely noisy with the tube just 150m away running past my room and I could hear next doors telephone conversation. The bed linen was worn tatty with stains drawings on the wall dirty carpet TV was on the floor and the mattress was very old and uncomfortable. My door was banging every 30 secs from the wind whistling down the corridor. Somehow I managed to ignore all those things mind over matter they say and attempted to log onto the internet. I couldn't connect so telephoned reception to be told they don't have internet access from the rooms but there is access down in the lobby however it was broken at that time - genius! That was the icing on the cake I packed up my things proceeded to reception demanded a refund and moved to a hotel down the road who upgraded me once I told them about my awful experience at the Britannia Hotel.This hotel is in desperate need of a big shake up. I've stayed in better hostels than this.Don't waste your money find another hotel.

9,breakfast:3★ cleanliness:3★ service:3★ price:1★ location:0★,10,"Nov 4 2009 	Conveinent for O2	We picked this hotel based on its location: one stop on the tube from the O2 (after an event) and very close to my husband's office in Canary Wharf.It's fine if you just need a place to crash for the night in that area and get a good deal but don't expect anything special. The main drawbacks are:-very hot rooms very noisey and poor A/C and unable to open windows;- next to DLR line (although it doesn't run all night)-thin walls so you could hear your neighbours flush their loos shower tvs etc;-noisey loo flush (so take ear plugs if you're a light sleeper);-generally tired and out of date decor;-hard beds; and-poor quality linen.It could really do with a refurbishment.

11,breakfast:5★ cleanliness:5★ service:5★ price:4★ location:3★,26,"Oct 25 2009	Mouse in dining room!!!	Just got back from the worst hotel stay of my life here. My daughter and I had a day in London planned when i received an email from Britannia Hotels offering a special deal so we decided to book in and make a weekend of it. Bad decision. The room was smelly and stuffy it was very hot even though we had the heating turned down to 16 degrees and there were no windows that we could open. There were 10 very noisy fans on the roof right outside our bedroom room 503 which were on all the time and were so loud it was almost impossible to sleep. We were put on the same corridor as a group of school children who were incredibly noisy and were running up and down the corridor screaming into the small hours. The decor was very tatty the bottom of the bed was frayed and it was so narrow it was difficult to turn over in the night without falling out. To top it all we tried the carvery in Jenny's restaurant on our first night and as we were finishing dinner we spotted a mouse running around under the tables scouting for supper. We pointed it out to the waiter who didn't seem too surprised because it wasn't the first time he'd seen it there. Definately a hotel to avoid.

12,breakfast:2★ cleanliness:0★ price:0★ service:0★ location:0★,-12,"Oct 25 2009 	Grubby worn and unhelpful.	I stayed in the International Britannia Hotel with about 15 pupils and staff as part of a conference being held for two days three nights. ROOMThe room was incredibly dated to say the least. The decor was hideous and without a theme. The artwork was quite raunchy including naked people in suggestive positions (remembering I'm a student). The TV didn't work and the only way it could be turned off was at the switch neither did the remote. The toilet door wouldn't lock one person was put on a camp bed the front door broke so it was a struggle for it to lock so no-one could come in without a card. The only way to boil the kettle was to balance it on the bed due to the immense lack of normal plug sockets. We phoned up reception three times to get someone to come up to fix the TV they managed to do it but the manager who came said he would send up maintainence to fix the doors. He didn't. We had to call a further three times and even then it only got fixed as we was leaving on the third day despite all the calls occuring on the first day. The mirror was broken and the view was of a construction site (including the lovely sounds at 6am). As we walked into the room we found an apple on the chandelier from the last inhabitants. The air con was noisy and it never had a decent temperature it was either glacial or boiling. The beds weren't too bad except the camp bed. The hot drink facilities were good as there was a variety to choose from such as hot chocolate decaf tea etc. FACILITIESPrior to the stay we had been reassured that there would be a swimming pool and gym avaliable to us when we wasn't in the conference room. So after a day of meetings all the group wanted was to work out and go for a swim however the swimming pool was shut for the Friday and Saturday we were there for and the gym was unavaliable on the Saturday due to a class being taught. When we did manage to get into the gym it had a nice range of high-tec machines and there was a bar closeby for anyone wanting the spa or some fruit an energy bar or a drink. The swimming pool was surprisingly small compared to the photos shown on the website and incredibly cold quite clearly unheated. The sauna and steam room was very nice.RESTAURANTSIn the mornings our group had the breakfast buffet at Jenny's restaurant in the afternoons we had pizza in the pizzeria and in the evenings we had the three-course carvery meal. The food from Jenny's restaurant is faultless. It had a wide range for both vegetarian and such. The meat from the carvery was outstanding and the entire breakfast was brilliant. The pizzeria didn't quite have the same effect with me. The pizza was burnt and airy and the coke that came with the pizza was barely a drip until our last meal there where they decided to give us full pint glasses. I would recommend Jenny's restaurant to any stayers of the hotel but I wouldn't recommend the pizzeria to anyone.EXPENSEI didn't have anything to do with the booking and such so I haven't got much of a clue about the costs of the stay itself only of the bar. For a 200ml bottle of coke it was ï¿½2. I thought that was really taking the mick as the restaurant sold pints of coke for ï¿½2. I was not impressed by the price of that.I think that anyone who wishes to stay in London should look elsewhere. For a &quot;4 star hotel&quot; I would struggle to give it 2 stars. I can imagine it being very expensive and very disappointing to people who paid for it. I definitely think that there are far better hotels in the area.

We were kept awake at night by the DLR and extremely noisy air-con then woken by the noise from the construction site next door then a cleaner letting herself into the room at 8am. We pre-booked the continental breakfast at ï¿½6 per head which consisted of oily croissants two cereals some rolls and processed cheese along with horrendous coffee and stewed tea.This hotel claims a four-star rating - I've stayed in two-star accommodations that have been far better.

14,service:0★ breakfast:0★ cleanliness:0★ price:0★ location:0★,-140,"Oct 22 2009 	Nice Hotel nice staff dissapointed discusted with duty manager decision tho	Dec 2008 i had a 10 day Holiday in London brittannia was recommended to me. I booked cheap on line for 3 nights to treat myself. Very impressed with the front desk and staff. I got little sleep due to train noise from 6.30 Am til 11.30 pm odd - plus the heating/cooling system would not regulate to a comfortable level. The room was spacious enough and bath luxurious. Last day I used the health/gym/pool facilities downstairs decided to treat myself to a tanning booth session (the minimnum 6 odd minutes). Being used to regular tanning at home &amp; having recently returned from Africa my colour fading.. The booth was DEF faulty or had BRAND new bulbs in the pod... I WAS S E V E R L Y B U R N T after just half my session. Pods with new bulbs normally have a warning sign on them to reduce tanning time. When I Panicked &amp; rang through to reception to explain the Hotel refused to take any responsibility &amp; the duty manager said I must have had an allergic reaction - which was ridiculous being used to regular tanning. I WAS BADLY BURNT ALL OVER / SICK &amp; needed EMERGENCY Hospital attention this was getting late at night - the burning had taken all evening to become sore. . After an hour of pleading and explaining at the desk the Hotel were kind enough to phone / book me a taxi (At my expense) &amp; printed me a &quot;Courtesy&quot; map of the nearest Hospital. Even though I told them I had no cash left for a taxi &amp; I was lost in that area of London. The desk staff took my mobile tel no &amp; said they would call me later on I had no credit on my Mb either. A female sick &amp; Alone at Midnight I walked out lost towards the Hosp with their map. {My travel pal was not with me the last night} When I returned 3 hours later on strong coedine pills with medicine &amp; a prescription for the morning I was FURIOUS at my eve ordeal. In severe pain nauseous shaking no body temperature control &amp; scared for my own safety out on foot in dark streets. In the Hosp the desk staff had rung my mobile but my phone was switched off in the hosp. The manager even made me then beg him to let me check out later than normal in the morning. In the middle of my holidays I had to make alternative plans to get straight home which was expensive and inconvienient to say the least. After a 2 week recovery period &amp; various doctor's visits - I wrote in length to Brittannia with details from the Doctor who had examined my burnt skin &amp; letter of proof to say i used tan booths regularly etc.... STILL Had N O reply as yet. P.S. the morning I checked out the tanning booth was open as usual as if nothing had happened.  Now I am curious to see if I get a reply on here ! ! TOTALLY discusting treatment in such a high class Hotel.

15,price:5★ breakfast:5★ cleanliness:4★ service:5★ location:3★,26,"Oct 15 2009 	Fantastic Value for Money!	A place to stay for a trip to see The Jersey Boys and after trawling the internet I came across the Britannia. We got a special deal for a twin room that included breakfast so to be honest at ï¿½158 for two nights for two people we weren't expecting The Ritz. However how wrong were we in fact what we got was a warm smiley welcome which set the theme for the weekend.I have to be honest we were given a room that immediately put me in the 'grr' frame of mind one right by the lifts and one that although it backed on to the waterfront also to the DLR railway. I always travel with earplugs so to be honest it wouldn't have been a problem however we never had any distubance from the lifts and the railway due to engineering works only ran on the Friday evening. My only other three issues with the room were that the twin beds were single ones I guess that comes with being spoilt at other hotels that provide doubles the shower head (tiny) and lack of lighting (make-up application). Other than that everyting was pretty much spot-on.We decided to eat in on Friday no booking required and headed to Jenny's Carvery. Fantastic helpful friendly staff one of whom when we departed on Sunday morning after our ample full english shook our hands and said 'It's always sad when nice people check out'! Three courses for ï¿½15 - excellent! Our only critiscm here was lack of signage - nothing to say three courses some of the food items on offer and refreshments on the tea/coffee table didn't have appropriate signage. The whole bill for both with drinks came to ï¿½40.Saturday morning we sampled the breakfast selection fruit yoghurt toast cereals and full English. Obviously we didn't have all of the above (no yoghurt) and again it was excellent. We dined in the Pizzeria Saturday evening - total bill with tip for starter mains (including perfectly cooked sea bass) came to ï¿½47 for two. The only disappointment were the coffees in the bar later in the evening although the Baileys cheered them up!Again on Sunday we enjoyed the breakfast. All in all I'm looking forward to staying there again in the near future. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff. It's worth mentioning too that the waiter in the Pizzeria has worked there for several years which for the hotel/catering industry speaks volumes. A big thumbs up Britannia International - in a climate of financial doom and gloom you certainly put two big smiles on these 'girls' faces! On-site parking too at excellent rate - Thank you!

17,breakfast:5★ cleanliness:5★ service:5★ price:4★ location:3★,27,"Oct 11 2009	Not too bad alright to stay in	The first thing I noticed about the hotel was after seeing the typical characterless outside the inside seemed like another world. I thought it seemed very odd but it didn't bother me much although it's not my favourite style. Staff seemed alright but lived up to the 'international' part of the name.It's a bit further out than most hotels but as I'm used to doing a 30min each way commute back home 15 minutes on the tube to Central London wasn't an issue.Beds in my room were pretty horrible to sleep on and the lift to the fourth floor was like trying to catch public transport (wait 5 minutes then it's too full to get in). The selection of restaurants wasn't to crash for the night if you get a good deal price wise.great but overall the place is alright

18,price:5★ cleanliness:5★ breakfast:5★ service:5★ location:5★,37,"Oct 5 2009 	Great value very comfortable.	Was offered an upgraded to a deluxe room at no extra cost- very quick sign in from courteous staff.. Had a 9th floor room with the most amazing views of both the Thames and Canary Wharf. Spacious room - nicely decorated and pristinely clean.Couldn't have asked for anything better.Wonderful location right next to DLR and Jubilee Line ( check weekend works closures for Jubilee at present). Also within a stone's throw of Canary Wharf pier with Clipper boat service to Westminster O2 and Greenwich .Brillant boat service but pricey. Best to but a Roamer ticket to give all day hop on and off travel- you can even go through the Thames Barrier on Clipper. An evening Clipper trip in the dark is wonderful- but beware that the ticket expires at 10pm and you will be charged again after that time.Combined with inclusive continental breakfast this stay was a brilliant deal. I would reccommend it wholeheartedly. I was put off by other reviews on this hotel on Tripadvisor but I did not experience any of the negative comments posted there.

Gaudy and kitch - way out dated and very tired.The decor in the room is a mish mash which all looks incredibly dated - not to mention the incredibly odd (and raunchy!) artwork. Above my dark wood ornate headboard is a very bizarre print of naked men!The bed is way way beyond it's sell by date and I can just about feel the springs pushing through. Bedding is cheap and basic with hard pillows.The skirting on the bed is frayed and so creased it will never be straight and smooth again.The room is clean and doesn't smell - the view is OK and the noise levels are well contained. Those are about the only plus points.Seriously go somewhere else if you have the option.

Could do with dressing gowns in the rooms but this is the only complaint really. transport links are quite good with DLR and tube services close by also the hotel seems to have its own chaffeuer service at very reasonable rates we used this service to go to Mayfair and it was the same price as a black cab! all in all a decent hotel

Room was gfloomy outside the window were the noisy air handling units decor is just plain odd bathroom did not have a free standing shower but one that you have to stoop to get into (pet hate) and no minibar (this is 4*?!)Room service was grim got sirloin steak that I think had been cooked for 2 hours in vinegar. No cold beer in my choice.No iron in the room and an age to track someone down to answer the phone to send one upGym does not open till 7 no good for a business traveller who likes to be at the desk for 8.

24,breakfast:5★ cleanliness:5★ price:5★ service:5★ location:3★,26,"Sep 7 2009 	Fantastic Hotel - Penthouse Suite a must!!	I booked the Penthouse Suite for myself and my boyfriend. After booking I read some reviews of this site and was a bit nervous about it as some reviews were saying the hotel was a bit dated and the rooms were in need of updating.But upon arriving at the International nothing could be more wrong. The foyer itself was beautiful and the decoration is by no means tired and dated. It is traditional and quite grand. Maybe the people writing bad reviews prefer trendy modern and minimalist decor hence the comments. The reception staff could not have been more friendly and helpful.The penthouse suite itself was stunning. Upon entering the room there is an iron spiral staircase taking you up to the suite. The living room is very spacious with mahogany sideboards dining table and dresser and leather sofas with floor to ceiling windows leading out onto a private balcony with stunning views. The bedroom was spacious although obviously smaller than the living area and beautifully decorated again with stunning views of Canary Wharf and beyond. The bathroom has a jacuzzi bath big enough for two! The location of the hotel is a bit far from the centre of London if thats were you want to go and I believe there is a train not to far away to take you into the centre but we took the Thames Clipper fast ferry which is only a five minute walk away from the hotel which takes you to all different parts of London and I would recommend this. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel and will definately stay again.

It was very reasonable and not booked directly with the hotel. The room was fine three single beds as it was a family room we overlooked the water which is quite a lovely view. The room and bathroom were clean. The breakfast was included as continental but we just walked into the main place and had the buffet full english. We were not challenged but it was about twenty mins before closing time as my nephew wouldnt get out of bed! The food was lovely trying to get a hot drink was very difficult. The staff are very busy and seem to forget. The pool was quite cold and there was a terrible smell in the changing rooms if you were looking to stay at a hotel just to enjoy the pool facilities I really wouldn't reccomend this one. Overall this hotel was fine for two nights the location was good about a ten min walk from the tube and docklands railway.

It was clean comfortable the staff were helpful our bedroom and bathroom were clean spacious and well equipped. So maybe not evryone likes chandeliers - you can choose your own decor at home how are hotels supposed to please all tastes? And if you don't want to see and hear a train or a tube from your window - don't choose a hotel in Canary Wharf area right next to a DLR stop! I would stay here again the location is fantastic and my only very slight complaint is the way some of the tour groups were shoved upstairs out of the way in a conference room for breakfast.

It was booked as a package through a coach tour company and we had no idea what to expect but we were most impressed! It's a brilliant location a lovely clean hotel helpful staff great breakfast. The room was spotlessly clean and the bathroom was lovely - even had a bathroom scale!. Since returning home I have checked out the reviews on this site and cannot believe some of the negativity - although I get the feeling that some of the worse ones go back a year or two. Speaking as of now August 2009 I absolutely recommend this place. So what if you don't like the decor in a hotel all you reviewers out there? You get to choose your own at home. How do you expect hotels to please everyone? And if you don't like being able to see or hear a train or a tube - go to the countryside!!My only slight grouch was that coach parties were expected to be separate in some sort of converted conference room which is a bit less atmospheric than the main dining room and has quite a bit less choice although it was still the full brecky. Reminds you that maybe some of us package hol. travellers are the poor relations?

We had a pleasant stay and the room was very spacious and more than up to our expectations. We were put in a double room on the 10th floor at the front of the hotel in the direction of Canada Square with a wonderful view over the water. The room was very clean with a nice en-suite and was decorated in what I would call non-offensive classic style. The bed was comfy and certainly not lumpy as per some of the other comments on here. We actually had a very good nights sleep. People who complain about things like chandeliers mirrors in the lifts and ornaments in the corridors are quite frankly just looking for any little thing they can to moan about!! The hotel staff seemed friendly and helpful enough and the hotel itself certainly wasn't smelly. In fact the corridors and room had a noticeable fragranced smell about them.I agree that the included continental breakfast in the pizzeria restaurant is quite basic but you have to accept that as a freebie you're not going to get a banquet. If you're really not happy with the selection offered then you do have the choice of walking 10 metres across to the main restaurant and paying ï¿½13.50 per person for a much bigger choice of breakfast including full English. We didn't pay any extra ourselves and were quite happy with the basic breakfast of cereals croissants rolls toast cheese/conserves yoghurt and juice/tea/coffee.If you want a good deal then make sure you search one of the travel supermarket type websites instead of booking direct with the hotel. This is what I did and got our double room for a nightly rate of ï¿½59 including breakfast which was an absolute bargain and even cheaper than a lot of budget type hotels with a lower star rating and no breakfast included.Based on our experience we would definitely go back to this hotel again.

HiHaving read previous reviews i though 'well cant be that bad' i mean chandeliers aint always a bad thing.As we got dropped off to the hotel i was thinking good move here the place looks pretty darn sweet. Into the reception area i was suddenly reminded of a review i had read serious chandelier overload!The reception lobby was a kind of victorian theme but in a bad 80's style!I always gauge a hotel on how long it takes to get checked in well there was only one member of staff on at 7pm on a Sunday evening!Waiting for the lift we had a chuckle about the number of chandeliers and into the lift. Seriously remove some mirrors i've already been to the barber i dont need a mirror infront behind and all around me i've no need to be reminded of how great my hair looks from each side nor do i need to see an infinate number of myself getting smaller and smaller as i peered into the mirrors.Out of the lift we were greeted by some strange fat chineese warrior holding some sort of a weapon oh come on victorian/80's and now some chineese ornaments!Into the room twin beds that might as well have been a double there was such a small gap between the beds. I mean we are friends but not that close friends!Another good guage of a hotel is the TV in the room well this baby should have been on antiques road show i was suprised not to see a Fergison Video Star beneth it!The beds were hard as nails and i had a spodge of blood on my sheets always makes a good impression!I did like the bar downstairs that was level with the water outside. The pizza's are quite nice although it did come with olives i asked for no olives but that was easily fixed.Needless to say i very much doubt i will be staying at the Britannia Hotel London again very time soon!I think the hotel should rephrase the hi speed wifi sign as well!Thanks for reading.

The place comes across as being built in the initial heyday of thw wharf and then running out of money.We stayed two nights and the staff were unhelpful some trays left outside rooms on our first night were still there when we left. The room was shabby and there was no mini bar. When we asked whent he restaurant closed we were told it closes when there are no more orders. Great we thought but the food was poor and the room service was no better.It's hard to believe it is 4 star compared to nearby hotels. One to avoid.

32,service:2★ breakfast:0★ cleanliness:0★ price:3★ location:2★,7,"Aug 3 2009 	Pleasantly surprised!	Stayed at this hotel for 1 night as I was going to a gig at the nearby O2. Kind of expected a very basic hotel due to reading some reviews here but I was pleasantly surprised. Sure the hotel is a bit dated and a bit shabby but for me its location to Canary Wharf and the O2 along with the very resonable price made it a great choice. Room was bigger than I expected and was good for a single room except that the bed was a bit hard for me (but for 1 night that was ok). Didn't eat in the hotel but did use the pool which was a fairly decent facility. Staff were helpful enough. Not sure if I would stay here if I was visiting central London but would recommend for concert-goers looking for a place to kip after a gig!!

I must defend this hotel	Having read some of the reviews from people I feel i must defend the hotel.Myself and my wife stayed at the hotel on the new year break package 2008 and there is no way i can fault it at all. My standards no in no way low and i would be the first person to complain if i had to But some of the reviews by people are totally unfair to the hotel and staff unless something drastic has happened in the last seven months. Anyway the room was excellent i cant remember the number but it had a spiral staircase from the room door up to the bedroom itself and a patio door out onto a balcony were you could see the Thames-excellent clean and all we needed.Next the food as much as we wanted to eat sometimes the chef would come round to your table and ask if everything was okay -a nice touch.Staff in general were very good and pleasent -Thinking back are we talking about the same hotel ! We are definately Going to stay this New year

I stayed here for 2 nights with my husband the hotel is very grand in the foyer but the dinning room is very tired and needs a revamp. The tables are made of wood and they didn't have table covering so looked rather grubby the setting is great actually overlooking the water. The rooms were clean but very dated the view we had was GREAT from the seventh floor we overlooked the dock and the O 2 arena the docklands light railway and canary wharf. Food was good and plentiful commplimentory bathroom goodies tea making facilities but the bed left a lot to be desired lumpy. The location was fabulous with 5 minutes walk to underground and light railway. I love water and trains so this more than made up for letdowns for me.would definately stay again. 10 minutes into town on the underground or light railway buy a day ticket very good value.we took the open top bus which also includes a trip on the river either to geenwich or westminster and the jack the ripper walking tour at ï¿½24.00 excellent value.

35,price:2★ breakfast:3★ cleanliness:3★ service:5★ location:3★,16,"Jul 25 2009	With excellent service and accommodation this hotel provides fantastic value	Despondent having read so many negative comments about the hotel I arrived as part of a bus tour from Scotland expecting grubby and noisy surroundings. To our delight we quickly realised that we were about to be treated to four very pleasant nights. I had asked for a quiet single room and found that without any fuss on our arrival I had been given this on the tenth floor overlooking the Thames. The bed was comfortable and although a light sleeper I slept well. The room and en suite were spotless and attentively attended to by housekeeping every morning; the buffet breakfasts and dinners offered a wide choice in the restaurant which looked out over Canary Wharf (indeed if you sat by the window it felt as though you were at sea!); and all of the staff were particularly helpful and pleasant. There was no question of being treated as a second-class citizen because we were on a bus trip. Independent travellers need have no fear since although a lot of groups were staying at the hotel it seemed that they had separate restaurant accommodation although I cannot be certain about this. The hotel is ideally situated for all of London since it is very close to Canary Wharf Tube Station and to The Docklands Light Railway. It took me twenty minutes to reach the hotel from the National Theatre on the South Bank and the same time to Greenwich Maritime Museum on the DLR. A Day Ticket will cost you only ï¿½5.60. So please do not be put off by the complaints below; I don't understand how anyone could find fault with the hotel.

Only stayed for one night (thankfully). When I got there for some reason there wasn't a room booked for me...annoying. Then when I finally got a room it was decorated in an old fashioned way (not my style) and it had an old smell about it. It wasn't too far from canary wharf which was probably the best thing about it. Wasn't impressed...don't think I'd stay there again. Maybe I'm being a little bit harsh...it was good enough for the night really but wouldn't want to stay a bit longer. I have become a bit of a snob when it comes to hotels as well now!

Breakfast (continental) is very very basic (bun &amp; croissant with marmalade and some cereals orange juice and coffe/tea).Definitely okay if you just want to sleep there.

After reading the reviews on this page I was concerned but I think some people like to complain. The room was bigger than expected the bathrom was clean furnishings in good condition breakfast was plentiful with lots of choice. The walk to Canary Wharf was closer than I thought it may have been. If you prepurchase a Travelcard it is cheap to get around. Stayed at a more expensive hotel closer to the city centre after our trip to Europe and it was nowhere near as good as this one.On the downside we found everywhere in the UK was overheated and this was no exception.

If you want to tour London all day and just need a place to rest your head after a days journey then this is the Hotel for you. And that's is exactly what we did for the 6 nights we stayed in London. The hotel is pretty much what everyone says a three star hotel at best the beds are not the greatest-you do feel the springs poking your body and the rooms could by all measures use a face lift. My friend did ask for another mattress and he was provided with one in the same day. The bathroom was decent the shower was probably the best aspect of the entire room. The room was smal but I guess that should be expected. We had one problem the sink would not drain our second day there. But Housekeeping fixed the problem by the time we returned to the room later in the evening. I really didn't have too much interaction with the staff but the little I did went relatively well no coplaints there. The hotel is not far from the Tube either but the cab ride from the airport to the hotel cost 40 pounds way to much. We ended up taking a series of trains to the airport for the return journey home. Took about an hour and a half and 4 - 5 different trains but well worth not spending 40pounds on a cab. I will not stay at this hotel if I visitt London again though. It's an OK hotel it doesn't require more than one extended stay.

I stayed here for 1 night as i was going to the O2 to watch a concert so in terms of location it was fairly good although when you come off the tube at Canary Wharf i wouldn't really want to be lugging suitcases as is still a 10 minute walk from station across a bridge and through a carpark!!!The foyer was very grand but old fashioned very green with chandeliers and it had a bar in the lobby area which was quite nice.We upgraded to a superior suite for ï¿½20 which they were saying was a 1 day special only but not too sure of that. Quite frankly not really worth the ï¿½20. The room was big but looked like a 70's sitting room and even though it had a nice view it was a communal balcony which shocked me as a random man walked past!!! When you open the door there was a spiral staircase to take you to room again if i had suitcases i would not be happy it was bad enough after a few drinks!!I did not have breakfast as left early but don't think i would've missed much.All in all a good budget hotel if you stay for maybe a couple of nights max but no more than that.

45,breakfast:0★ cleanliness:0★ price:1★ service:0★ location:2★,-12,"May 31 2009 	Definately Not 4 Star!!	Where do I start? Well when booking we requested a room on the first to third floor as my husband does not do elevators. When checking in we were given a room on the 8th floor. We were told that the rooms on the first to 6th floors were only twin beds that could not be moved together and were smoking rooms. Meanwhile we noticed that our room had two twin beds pushed together! The hotel needs to put some money into refurbishing.....it is very tired looking. The bathroom had peeling paint on the ceilings the toilet flusher was attached to the wall and very loose and the taps which once must have been a gold color were now a scatchy looking silver brown.We had a very uncomfortable sleep as the springs in the mattress were sticking into our ribs and we heard the trains going most of the evening and early morning. Noticed that the window was missing some screws and was open at the top. We informed Front Desk about our problem with the mattress and window. They sent someone up to fix the window. At first they were going to switch us to another room and then suddenly there was not another room. We asked for a second duvet to make the mattress more comfortable for sleeping and when we returned from our evening out they had only given us the blanket that was in the closet. Our friends gave us their blanket from their room and when we lifted the sheets to put the blankets under them we were appauled at what we saw. The mattress was worn stained and on the side it was falling apart. My friend took pictures with her camera and hopefully will post them but her comment was &quot;I wouldn't let my dog sleep on that mattress!&quot; Don't expect too much in the continental breakfast....it only consists of cereal croissants and buns. We had a difficult time getting someone to give us more cream for our coffee....none of the staff are very accomodating or attentive to their customers needs. (A little note here.....we were visiting friends in the UK from Canada and stayed here to see some of the sights of London. We are all very open minded but we felt more of an intrusion on the staff none of whom seemed very excited about working at this hotel). The Front Desk staff are not very pleasant to speak to....(usually you get a smile and a &quot;How can I help you&quot; when you approach the front desk....but not at this hotel)....very somber and stodgy employees!! On our second night we were talking to the barman and as he seemed very unhappy working there we asked him if he liked his job. His response was &quot;of course not&quot;. Apparently he is an aspiring Polish IT guy who cannot get a job in his field in the UK as his written English is not very good and so he lowered himself to the job of Barman for now. The only time we got a smile out of him was when we gave him a nice tip. I think the only way to get him to show a little more enthusiasm and life would have been to light a fire under his butt.I think I have covered pretty much our experience with this hotel. Would I go back....no way....would I recommend it to a friend....no way....Would I recommend it to an enemy....DEFINATELY!! (just to get even)Anyway....take my advise....or don't....I just want to make sure that people are advised about our experience before they make their own decision. I am sure that by putting in some of the money that is charged for the room to upgrade the Hotel it may one day be the hotel that it once was.....but for now I would stay clear!!Nora WhiteCambridge Ontaro Canada
