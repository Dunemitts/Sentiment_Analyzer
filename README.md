Note:

The provided txt files are used for testing, with hotel_texting.txt being a smaller scale version than uk_england_london_britannia_international_hotel.txt

The main function to process the files is process_file(filename) while the other two functions, display_stopwords_and_lemmatize(filename) and analyze_document_sentiment(filename) are used purely to display answers for CIT 44400/CIT 58100 Homework 6, they do not contribute to the processed file at all.

There is already a processed file in the repository called hotel_processed.csv (which can be overwritten) that displays an end product of processing hotel_texting.txt
